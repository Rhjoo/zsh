This is my .zshrc file on my Mac mini after installing MacOS Catalina, which now comes in with zsh by default instead of bash as scripting language. Copied and pasted a script found googling, which allows "code" to open VS Code. Also copied and pasted a script that allows NVM file path. 

Also included is the oh-my-zsh theme I'm using. I modified Invika theme I found from an external theme site.
